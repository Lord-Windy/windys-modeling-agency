# windys-modeling-agency
Just a collection of all my models that I'm making as I learn Blender. You can use it for literally anything

I've licensed this under BSD but I'm happy for you to modify this to anything.

Things inside the References folder will have issues with Copyright. But they are only colourwheels so I imagine that the owners won't mind too much. In the future I might purge them out. Actual pictures will be public domain only. (I cannot draw)
